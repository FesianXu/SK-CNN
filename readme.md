# Implement SK-CNN in Keras
SK-CNN is proposed in [《Skeleton Based Action Recognition with Convolutional Neural Network》](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/english/irds/People/lwang/M-MCG_EN/Publications/2015/YD2015ACPR.pdf). It organizes the 3D skeleton information as a RGB image and feed the data into a CNN network achieving a convincing result.
